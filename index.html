			    exciting adventure, but I didn’t really know what to expect. 
			    I already had a project in mind - a community of practice for 
			    UNHCR web editors - but I wasn’t really planning on making it 
			    my ‘innovation project’ and it took me some time to realize 
			    that it could actually be a good option.

			<h4> Helena:  </h4>
                    <p class="text-small">I got an email from a friend about the fellowship. 
			    I thought, innovation and UNHCR?, sounds pretty cool!  
			    I didn’t think I would get in but I had to try! I had no idea 
			    of what to expect from the fellowship. Even Though I’ve always 
			    felt close to innovation (due to my work with medical devices), 
			    I never saw myself as one. In fact, I thought I was too often 
			    playing it safe at work and that this fellowship would give the 
			    tools and confidence to be more disruptive.

			    the status quo a little more often than I used too.

			    <ul>
<li> The route has been different than what I initially anticipated: 
	not direct, but rather a long and winding road. I was initially 
	focusing on the implementation only, but the fellowship forced me 
	to step back to self-reflect, take some detours to get feedback from 
	a lot of different colleagues, and question the utility and usability 
	of the product at every step. In the end, I think (and hope) that I get 
	a much better product than what I would have delivered without the fellowship.

			    
<li> Things changed. World has changed since. We have changed in how we think, 
	what we do and how we approach things.

			    
<li> I didn’t know what to expect. I had some preconception on how things would 
	be and what I’d do. I thought I’d had this one big project and at 
	the end I got many smaller projects but I think it turned out better 
	and more interesting than I imagined it. </ul>

			    I feel like a Dr Frankenstein who wants to keep experimenting with the living thing he has created.
Success is not necessary. It does not matter if the project is implemented and adopted, it is the journey that matters. 
			    It is about learning about innovation and about yourself.
Keep enlightenment alive. Keep learning alive. Not to go back to “traditional” or how I was doing it before. 
			    I do not want the fellowship to end. What is after?
